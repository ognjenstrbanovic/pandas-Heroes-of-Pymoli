I've landed a job as a Lead Analyst for a gaming company! Well, not really.  
:sweat_smile:  
I was assigned to choose one of two challenges. I chose the first, which was to use what I've learned about Python pandas and analyze the fictional fantasy game *Heroes of Pymoli*. Players are encouraged in this game to purchase optional items, and so I was to generate a report that breaks down the game's raw purchasing data into meaningful insights. The report was to include: player count, purchasing analysis (total), gender demographics, purchasing analysis (gender), age demographics, top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items; this, as well as a written description of three observable trends based on the data.  
I used the Jupyter notebook for the programming portion of this assignment.
